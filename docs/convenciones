# Troubleshooting
## My repository is detected as the wrong language
If the language stats bar is reporting a language that you don't expect:
1. Click on the name of the language in the stats bar to see a list of the files that are identified as that language.
   Keep in mind this performs a search so the [code search restrictions][search-limits] may result in files identified in the language statistics not appearing in the search results.
   [Installing Linguist locally](/README.md/#installation) and running it from the [command line](/README.md#command-line-usage) will give you accurate results.
2. If you see files that you didn't write in the search results, consider moving the files into one of the [paths for vendored code](/lib/linguist/vendor.yml), or use the [manual overrides](/docs/overrides.md) feature to ignore them.
3. If the files are misclassified, search for [open issues](https://github.com/github/linguist/issues) to see if anyone else has already reported the issue.
   Any information you can add, especially links to public repositories, is helpful.
   You can also use the [manual overrides](/docs/overrides.md) feature to correctly classify them in your repository.
4. If there are no reported issues of this misclassification, [open an issue](https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/new) and include a link to the repository or a sample of the code that is being misclassified.

Keep in mind that the repository language stats are only [updated when you push changes](how-linguist-works.md#how-linguist-works-on-githubcom), and the results are cached for the lifetime of your repository.
If you have not made any changes to your repository in a while, you may find pushing another change will correct the stats.
